# Sentiment Analysis using RNN models

A deep learning project to detect sentiments using the popular twitter(X) dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset
[Kaggle - Sentiment-140](https://www.kaggle.com//sentiment140)

## Overview
- Preprocessed highly imbalanced data
- Trained RNN models- LSTM, GRU,BiLSTM
- Evaluated via classification report and confusion matrix

## Final Results
- **GRU gives the best scores of evaluation metrices**
- **Recall (GRU): 0.82**
- **Precision (GRU): 0.82**

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
3. Run the notebook inside `/notebooks/`

## Notes
- Dataset is not included due to size. Download it from Kaggle.
